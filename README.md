# Graph DAO
A functional implementation of distributed autonomous organization (DAO).  Actions are represented as stateful functions.  Functions are executed based on activity signalling from an activation vector at decision timepoints.

## Requirements

- python==3.8
- an environment manager (miniconda, pipenv, virtualenv)

## Usage

Create python environment
```bash
# Conda
conda env create --file=graphdao.yaml

#pipenv not done - install packages manually or create a pipfile for me plz!
```

Launch jupyter notebook via shell or anaconda prompt
```bash
cd root/folder
jupyter notebook
```
